# AntiTeamFlash

## Introduction
AntiTeamFlash is a plugin created for [Source.Python](https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python).  As such, it requires [Source.Python](https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python) to be installed on your CS:S or CS:GO game server.  It currently only works on CS:GO, but will be updated for CS:S in the future.

This plugin stops players from being flashed by teammates.
